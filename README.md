#To Play the Game
To play, press the **space bar** to start, then use the **arrow keys** to move around the screen.
To win a level, get across the road to the water without being hit by the enemy bugs.
Collect **gems** to increase your score.
Collect a **heart** to gain an extra life, or a **star** to be invincible for the rest of the level.

*See how high you can score!*
